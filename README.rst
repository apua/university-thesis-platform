Target
======

TeX/LaTeX is definite a powerful typesetting system. I do want the consistent beautiful typesetting by TeX/LaTeX, but I want to focus on content only.

HTML is definite a powerful hypertext content language cross modern web browsers. I do want the rapid collaboration over network, but I want to focus on content only.

There are public services we can leverage:

- distributed revision control, e.g. Github
- document hosting, e.g. ReadTheDoc
- modern web slides front end libraries

There are product we may refer to:

- plain text markup language with rich too, e.g. Org-mode
- web-based WYSIWYG with slide, e.g. Dropbox Paper
- web-based WYSIWYG with flavored Markdown, e.g. HackMD


Epic story
----------

Here I defined the epic story. It might be not great enough currently, but I think it is difficult enough:

  As an university student, I want a solution to focus on my thesis content [*]_ and collaborate with professor and colleague, I don't have to worry about thesis style and prepare environment for writing. Therefore, it is efficient to finish my thesis.

  .. [*] a thesis content includs whole structure, table of content, chapter/section/paragraph, figures/tables/formulas, references, and so on.
